This code was create a few years ago (end/start of 2023/2024) and so is not as well made/coded as I would have liked.
Doing this project allowed me to improve my programming, learn what mistakes to watch out for, and the importance of OOP structural planning (for example I had not learnt how to use inheritence for objects at the time, so it is not used in the code)
