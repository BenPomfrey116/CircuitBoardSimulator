Developed as part of my A-Level project (2023), since writing it my skills have improved, and with hindsight, there are many changes I would make to it if creating it again.

My initial objective for the project was to create a electrical circuit simulator for A'level and GCSE students to experiment with and practive or improve their understanding of the topic. Sometimes it may not function as intended, due to the limitations of pygame and threading (python modules) and their versions.

Developing this project allowed me to improve my programming skills using complex data structures, and reflecting on it I’ve learnt how to better optimise them and code which I’ve applied in further/newer code. I’ve learnt what mistakes to watch out for, and the importance of OOP structural planning beforehand, for example I had not properly understood how to use inheritance for objects a the time, so it is not used here.
