This code was create a few years ago (end/start of 2023/2024) and so is not as well made/coded as I would have been able to create today. Sometimes the program may not function as intended due to the limitations of pygame and threading, and sometimes has to be run multiple times for the pygame and tkinter windows to pop up.
Doing this project allowed me to improve my programming, learn what mistakes to watch out for, and the importance of OOP structural planning (for example I had not learnt how to use inheritence for objects at the time, so it is not used in the code)
